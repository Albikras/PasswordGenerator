# PasswordGenerator

## Description

My motivation for this project was to see how my javascript skills have developed so far, it has only been about a week since we started javascript and since ive attempted a password generator before the program started i wanted to see if i could now do it whilst in the program.  The reason i built this project was mainly to get a better understand of javascript and also how u can use html elements within javascript to enhance my website and users expirence.  The problem my program solves is getting a new password, and a randomly generated one at that, this program will give you a randomly generated password based on the ursers critria.  If they wanted to add numbers, lower case letters, uppercase letters, and special characters this program is able to meet those expectations.  The things i learned whilst developing this program was getElementbyid, how a checkbox works in javascript and how to make it a boolean value(you have no idea how long that aprt took me) and using the .value methoed after a varible then a console.log that varible with the value to see what it is outputting.
